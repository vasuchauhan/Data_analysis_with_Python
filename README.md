# ðŸ“Š IBM Data Science Professional Certificate  
## Course 7: Data Analysis with Python

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains all Jupyter Notebooks and exercises for **Course 7: Data Analysis with Python**, a part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

This course focuses on the process of analyzing data using Python and builds upon the tools and libraries introduced in earlier courses of the specialization.

---

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

In this course, youâ€™ll learn to:

- Read, understand, and summarize data
- Clean, transform, and wrangle datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Use statistical techniques to identify relationships in data
- Build and evaluate regression models

Youâ€™ll be working with real datasets and will apply the skills learned to gain insights and make predictions.
